  content: `## Retro Computing: More Than Nostalgia

The blinking cursor on a monochrome screen. The satisfying clack of mechanical keyboards. There's a reason we're drawn to retro computing aesthetics beyond mere nostalgia.

In this exploration, we analyze how retro computing interfaces often embodied core principles that modern interfaces have abandoned: clear feedback, reduced distractions, and a focus on functionality over flashiness.

We'll examine how these principles can be applied to modern digital design to create experiences that respect user agency and promote deeper engagement rather than shallow addiction.

From the command line to brutalist web design, there's a growing counter-movement that recognizes the power of these approaches - not just as aesthetic choices, but as ethical ones.

Embracing the old might be our most revolutionary path forward.`
